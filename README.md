# Enhancers

The app gives the weather of three major cities: Turin, London and Rome.

You can search the weather of a particular city or the weather based on your location.

### Note to the reviewer

Regarding the API I decided to leave the api-key visible since as explained in the official React [documentation] it is not enough to put it in an .env file but you should take it from the backend.
Moreover it was a bigger project I would have also used Redux Thunk.
